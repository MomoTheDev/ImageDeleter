# Updating
I have enough time to manage this project by my own, you can suggest me some features you'd like or maybe report some bugs as well.
You can give suggestions and report bugs to me via Discord (MomoTheSiM#6478).

# Construction
The `Resolution` Constructor is `new Resolution(width, height)`
